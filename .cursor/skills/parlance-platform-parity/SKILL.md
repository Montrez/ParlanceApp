# Parlance platform parity

One web frontend. Two native hosts. Do not fork the UI.

## Sources of truth

| Layer | Where | Mirror / copy |
|---|---|---|
| Journal, settings, guides, CSS, JS | `Parlance/web/` | Byte-identical twin in `docs/` |
| GitHub Pages + Capacitor `webDir` | `docs/` | `npx cap copy android` after any `docs/` change |
| iOS host | `Parlance/*.swift` | WKWebView loads the Xcode-bundled `Parlance/web/` |
| Android host | `android/app/.../ParlanceBridge.java` | Capacitor WebView loads `docs/` |

Never edit only `docs/` or only `Parlance/web/` for a shared file.

## After every shared-frontend change

```
parity progress:
- [ ] Edited Parlance/web/ (not docs/ first)
- [ ] Mirrored the same files to docs/
- [ ] python3 scripts/check_platform_sync.py
- [ ] python3 scripts/check_guide_i18n.py
- [ ] npx cap copy android   (if Android will run the change)
```

`check_platform_sync.py` also fails when iOS and Android version numbers drift. Bump versions only with `python3 scripts/bump_version.py`.

## Overlay z-index

Phone chrome and overlays share one stack. Do not lower these.

| Surface | z-index |
|---|---|
| Phone coaching sheet (`.feedback-panel`) | 250 |
| Journal entry viewer (`#entryOverlay`) | 300 |
| Guide iframe (`#guideOverlay`) | 400 |

A guide is open when `body` has `guide-open`. That class must hide `.feedback-panel` and `.feedback-sheet-backdrop` so Contents / Back are not covered by FEEDBACK / PROMPTS / GUIDE.

## Native bridge

`journal.js` posts `{action: ...}` and waits on `window.__parlance*`. Both hosts implement the same actions. If you add an action on one side, add it on the other or list it in `IOS_ONLY_ACTIONS` in `check_platform_sync.py` with a reason.

Coach on both phones is the Qwen 0.5B fine-tune (`analyzeParlanceSLM`). The rules engine is a post-pass, not a stand-in. Android GGUF files are gitignored; produce them with `training/export_parlance_gguf.py`. Play ships them in the `parlance_models` install-time asset pack. Before a Play `bundleRelease`, remove `android/app/src/main/assets/models/*.gguf` so the base module stays under Play's size limit. The Java API is `net.ladenthin:llama` (the `llama-android` AAR is not on Maven Central). After `npx cap sync`, confirm `android/settings.gradle` still includes `:parlance_models`.

## Do not

- Sniff `platform === 'android'` in `journal.js` to hide a feature the other host already has
- Upload model weights to Firebase Storage
- Treat the rules engine as the coach
- Edit version numbers by hand
